## Overview

This application provides a user-friendly interface for processing large ZIP files containing cricket match data from [Cricsheet's experimental section](https://cricsheet.org/downloads/#experimental). It handles the extraction, transformation, and combination of multiple CSV files into a single, properly formatted output file.

### Key Features

- ðŸ“¤ Drag-and-drop or click-to-upload interface
- âš¡ Batch processing for efficient handling of large ZIP files
- ðŸ“Š Real-time progress tracking with detailed logs
- ðŸ”„ Automatic data type conversion and normalization
- ðŸ’¾ Downloads processed data in a pipe-separated format

## How It Works

1. **File Upload**: Users upload a ZIP file containing cricket match CSV data
2. **Processing Pipeline**:
   - Extracts files from ZIP archive
   - Processes files in batches of 500 for memory efficiency
   - Normalizes data types (converts numeric fields, handles missing values)
   - Combines processed data into a single output file
3. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates show:
   - Current processing status
   - Number of files processed
   - Detailed logs of operations
4. **Download**: Processed file available for download upon completion

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- HTML5 + CSS3 for the user interface
- JavaScript for handling file uploads and progress tracking
- Server-sent events for real-time progress updates

### Backend
- Flask web framework
- Pandas for data processing
- Python's built-in zipfile module for archive handling
- Threading for non-blocking file processing
